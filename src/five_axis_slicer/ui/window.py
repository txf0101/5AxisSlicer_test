Contains all the logic and processes required to run the interactive graphics window.

Developer notes:
    The GUI is split between this module and `controller.py`. This file owns
    the Pyglet window, OpenGL state, mouse/keyboard interaction, model buffers,
    and preview buffers. `controller.py` owns widgets and callbacks. They share
    state through imported globals because the original UI was written in that
    style. When refactoring, start by moving one state group at a time behind a
    small object rather than changing every callback in one step.
